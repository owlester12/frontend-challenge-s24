I'm a repeat applicant, so I've done this challenge before. The biggest features
I added was getting the course quality, difficulty, and instructor quality from the API,
implementing Fuzzy Searching, adding filters for pre-requisites, redoing the user interface,
making the application mobile responsive, and adding ESLint.

I found that the API call only works when using incognito mode (it gets a CORS error otherwise),
so please test it in incognito mode.

Additionally, I want to note that I did most of my styling in TailwindCSS and is why the class names are so long.

Also, I am aware that I used type any twiceâ€“ for storing the result of the API call and defining the function
for which fuzzy search will sort results. I didn't want to spend a lot of time searching the internet to find
the specific types to use, so I left any.

Thank you for reading my technical application, and I really hope to get into Penn Labs.
